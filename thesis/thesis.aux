\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Visualization of the concept of sound change as a walk in latent space. Here, sound changes are vectors from one word to another, where both word forms are given as points in latent space. The vector from /lob/ to /lop/ would be the same as from /tag/ to /tak/, as both vectors would describe the loss of voice in the word-final phoneme. This linear dependence means that if we fit a regression model from /tag/ to /tak/, we could generalize well to predict /lop/ from /lob/. The different lengths of the vectors are than proportional to probabilities of such as sound change to appear. Here, final devoicing should be more probable than a change from /lop/ to /tak/. \relax }}{4}}

If the model did not learn the difference, we would expect some uniform distributions over all words that contain /w/ in the input.
